**Project Scope and Steps:**
1. **Staff Information:** Extracted and compiled detailed staff profiles, including names, email addresses, and store IDs, to assess organizational structure and workforce demographics.

3. **Customer Engagement:** Analyzed customer data to determine active customer counts and assess potential liability related to data breaches, focusing on email addresses stored in the database.

4. **Film Inventory Diversity:** Investigated the breadth of MavenMovies' film inventory by counting unique film titles and categorizing them to understand market diversity and customer retention potential.
   
5. **Replacement Cost Evaluation:** Calculated the replacement costs for films in MavenMovies' inventory, including determining the least expensive, most expensive, and average replacement costs to support insurance valuation.

6. **Fraud Prevention Strategies:** Implemented payment monitoring systems and established maximum payment processing restrictions based on the analysis of average and maximum payment amounts processed by MavenMovies.

7. **Customer Segmentation:** Compiled a prioritized list of customer identification values based on rental transaction history to identify high-volume customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

**Tools Used:**
- **MySQL:** Utilized MySQL for database querying and analysis, leveraging its capabilities to extract, manipulate, and analyze large datasets efficiently.

**Outcome:**
The MavenMovies Data Analysis project enabled me to provide crucial insights into organizational operations and risk factors essential for our insurance policy renewal. By leveraging MySQL to analyze staff demographics, inventory management, customer engagement metrics, and financial transactions, I contributed to informed decision-making, enhanced operational efficiency, and effective risk mitigation strategies.

This project not only demonstrated proficiency in MySQL data querying and analysis but also showcased my ability to derive actionable insights that support strategic decision-making in business operations and risk management.
